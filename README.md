# Le Bonnet (clone) - ecommerce fullstack application

## What is this ðŸ¤·

I made the simplfied clone application of the original Le Bonnet shopify shop in my leisure time.
It's very good showcase of how easy is that to make a clone of any high functional application via such a cool modern library as React.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- Client written in Babel powered JavaScript
- API written manually in Firebase cloud service
- Authentication/Authorization
- Cart

## Stack ðŸ”¨

- React(hooks based components)
- Redux(thunk)
- styled-components(javascript/scss library)
- Firebase(manual API + firestore)

## Todo - (small fixes)

- [x] Clearify the redux part
- [x] Fix the cart update item feature
- [x] Make the app responsive
- [ ] Code review from and make changes if needed
